## Future Project Development

- Web3 portfolio tracker
- Transactions placed on Cryptaraâ€™s own PoS network
- Award users with native coins to incentivize using the network for transactions
- Using Cryptara as a tool for analysis/monitoring blockchain data
- Making a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) - blockchain-based organization used for governance of Ethereum dApps, propose and decide on changes
- Have cryptaraâ€™s algo trade with the money in the DAO treasury, and give holders the ability to vote on changes in the code of the algo
- Use smart contracts to execute arbitrage opportunity trades that only execute when profitable, using flash loan transactions (which depend on smart contracts for receiving, using, and paying back the loan in the same transaction)
