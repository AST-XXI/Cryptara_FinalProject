Final Project Proposal

Cryptara Developers: Alexis Santoyo Torres, Andrew Brown, Aaron Price, Jake Teele, Odette Popko



# Proposal for Cryptara Project 
1)  Covalent/Blockchain Data API
- Access organized multichain blockchain data
- Gather historical data from all main chains
- Access to Defi & NFT & on-chain metrics
- Run data analysis through ML portion 
2) Use Azure Virtual Machine to deploy & continue app development across the cloud

3) [TaraSwap](https://ast-xxi.github.io/Cryptara_FinalProject/)

- Web3 application that allows users to swap tokens in-app
- Utilizes Moralis 1Inch plugin which integrates DEX aggregator 1Inch
- Works with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom blockchains
---
## The final product will:
- Provide insight into the cryptocurrency market
- Make predictions based on user’s interest
- Provide a gateway to token-swapping transactions using the Ethereum network
- Leverage data acquired and cleaned from previous ML models (ran through NLP & TA) to run LSTM modeling
- Identify arbitrage opportunities in the market while utilizing bullish/bearish market momentum

---

### Future Project Ideas & Possible Directions
- Web3 portfolio tracker
- Building Cryptara into a one-stop-shop DEX
- Transactions placed on Cryptara’s own PoS network
- Award users with native coins to incentivize using the network for transactions
- Using Cryptara as a tool for analysis/monitoring blockchain data
- Making a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) - blockchain-based organization used for governance of Ethereum dApps, propose and decide on changes
- Have cryptara’s algo trade with the money in the DAO treasury, and give holders the ability to vote on changes in the code of the algo
- Use smart contracts to execute arbitrage opportunity trades that only execute when profitable, using flash loan transactions (which depend on smart contracts for receiving, using, and paying back the loan in the same transaction)
